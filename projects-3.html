                    <h3>Picture Viewer Repository</h3>
                    <p><img id="pictoviewLogo" src="resources/images/pictoview-logo.png" class="logo" />Pictoview is a central photos (and later songs/videos) repository. It allows viewers to access their photos in an organized and easy to use manner. It includes the ability to add customized tags to albums and later search upon those tags. The app allows users to store images in a centralized database without having to store the data on their devices.</p>
                    <p>It started as a means for me to store my large repository of pictures and organize them in a manageable fashion without having to store all the pictures on my mobile devices.</p>

                    <p>The project is divided into three Components, the client, the request server, and the Enterprise Java Bean.</p>
                    <h3>Client</h3>
                    <h4>Android</h4>
                        <p>The Android client uses volley to send HTTP requests to retrieve informations &amp; photos from the server using REST-ful API. <i>(Currently in development)</i></p>
                    <h4>Browser</h4>
                        <p>The browser is partially generated HTML page via JSP, with dynamically generated content via Ajax calls. Uses jQuery to process client response data and page dynamics.</p>
                    <h3>Server</h3>
                    <h4>Spring</h4>
                        <p>Uses Spring MVC to generate client JSP pages as well as Ajax JSON responses. Images are send via output streams.
                        </p>
                    <h4>REST</h4>
                        <p>Uses JAX-RS to supply API calls to the client. The information is taken from the enterprise bean.</p>
                    <h4>EJB</h4>
                    <p>The EJB provides access to the database which stores all the images and their information</p>
